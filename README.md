## Model Providers

This template ships with [xAI](https://x.ai) `grok-2-1212` as the default chat model. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:


## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Timeline Feature

The application now supports a persistent timeline feature for tracking progress across supplier workflows. This feature replaces the previous localStorage-based implementation with database storage for better persistence and synchronization.

### Key Components:

1. **Database Schema**:
   - The timeline is stored in the database with a schema defined in `lib/db/schema.ts`
   - A migration has been created in `lib/db/migrations/0007_add_timeline_table.sql`

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/timeline` - GET and POST endpoints for retrieving and updating timelines
   - Timelines are tied to specific chat IDs for context

3. **React Hooks**:
   - `useTimeline` - A React hook for interacting with timeline data

### Running the Migration:

To apply the timeline database migration, run:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
# or
yarn db:migrate
```

### Using the Timeline:

The timeline can be used from any component by importing the hook:

```tsx
import { useTimeline } from '@/app/hooks/useTimeline';

function MyComponent({ chatId }) {
  const { timeline, loading, error, addStep, removeStep, toggleVisibility } = useTimeline(chatId);

  // Use timeline data and functions here
}
```
